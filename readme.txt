Game Name: Evil Pacman

Description: A twist on the famous game Pacman where the lights are out, meaning you can only see so far in front of you thanks to a flashlight that Pac-Man has for these situations. Making the game more evil is the inclusion of poison dots, which look almost exactly like power dots except in color and effect, as they instantly kill you rather than allow you to devour ghosts.
